### Hand Gesture Recognition using opencv in python ###
### Project for Computer Vision(SemI 2017) at IITD ###

Crude explanation of the steps for gesture recognition:
1) Detect the hand from the background.
2) Getting the points that are between your fingers
3) Determining gestures by using the movement and number of points detected in step 2

Detailed explanation of steps:
1) Detect the hand from the background.

i) The entire process is used by using hsv format for image because it gives better results.
ii) Detect the range of skin colour of the user
iii) Apply a gaussian blur on the image to make it smooth
iv) Apply the filter using values acquired in step ii
v) Convert the image into a binary grayscale image
v) Take a gaussian blur on the image
vi) Take a 2D filter on the image
vii) Convert the image into a binary image

2) Getting the points that are between your fingers

i) Get the maximum contour in the image that is in a pre-specified window in the image.
ii) Fit a polygon on the contour
iii) Get the defect points (points of contour that are not in polygon)
iv) Remove the noisy defect points (points which make an angle greater than 90 deg)

3) Determining gestures by using the movement and number of points detected in step 2

i) Tracking the point movement will give us the motion of hand
ii) Getting the number of points will give the number of fingers shown by the user
iii) For removing noise from the gestures acquired we put a constraint on the points that if the gesture is the same for two frames.
